Our app was created to help users create fantastic drinks using only the ingredients they have available.

The typeahead software predicts what the user is going to input, and shows potential recipes based on the ingredients provided.

## Mission

> Our mission was to create a seamless
> drink forging experience that hepls the user.
> Instead of relying on recipes to make drinks, 
> our app lets you see what can make based on 
> what you already have at home.

## New Features!

  - Added a favorites page and button so logged in users can save their favorite recipes for later.

  - Used a new UI/UX design to redo the front-end
  - Designed with web first strategy which works seamlessly with mobile.
