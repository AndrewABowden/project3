Our app was created to help users create fantastic drinks using only the ingredients they have available.

The typeahead assists users in sorting through a large ingredient list while preventing common spelling mistakes and finding related items (ie: Vodka, Lemon Vodka).

## Mission

> Our mission was to create a seamless
> drink forging experience for the user.
> Instead of relying on recipes to make drinks,

> what you already have at home.
